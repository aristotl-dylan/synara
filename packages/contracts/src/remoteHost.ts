// FILE: remoteHost.ts
// Purpose: Schema-only contracts for SSH-reachable remote hosts: connection
//          configuration, launcher shapes, structured probe results, and the
//          per-host connectivity state machine's observable status.
// Layer: Shared contracts (schema only — all runtime logic lives in
//        @synara/shared/remoteCommand, remoteHostProbe, remoteHostConnectivity)

 * - `host-key-unsupported` is neither: the two ends share no host-key
