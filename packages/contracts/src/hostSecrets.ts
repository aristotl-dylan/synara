// FILE: hostSecrets.ts
// Purpose: The wire contract for E2E-encrypted Host Secrets sync (ADR 0004,
// spec slice E §3). Every field crossing this boundary is either an opaque
// byte string the account service stores verbatim or an integer it does
// arithmetic on — deliberately nothing it could interpret.
// Layer: contracts (schema-only)
// Depends on: baseSchemas, hostAuth (the pairing JWK shape).
