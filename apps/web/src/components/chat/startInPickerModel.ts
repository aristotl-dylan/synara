// FILE: startInPickerModel.ts
// Purpose: Pure selection model for the composer's "Start in" picker:
//          environment → that environment's projects → per-project workspace mode.
// Layer: Chat composer logic
// Exports: option building, filtering, readiness, and the resolved start target.
//
// Ownership is POSITIONAL: each environment option carries the projects that
// environment's own record holds. There is no ownership map to consult and no
// filter to forget — a project cannot appear under a host that did not report
// it, because the caller reads it out of that host's record in the first place.

 *
 * The three not-ready answers are kept apart because each implies a DIFFERENT
 * ACTION, and the note's whole job is telling the user what to do. DO NOT
 * collapse them back together — each merge states something false:
 *
 * - `unavailable` into `not-authenticated` tells someone to sign in on a host
 *   whose provider CLI is not installed. It is not signed in BECAUSE it is not
 *   there, so signing in cannot help. Sending a user to perform an action that
 *   cannot fix their problem is the exact failure class this feature exists to
 *   remove, reintroduced one level down.
 * - `unknown` into `not-authenticated` accuses a host whose status has simply
 *   not arrived yet. `ServerProviderStatus.authStatus` is three-valued
 *   precisely so "we have not heard" stays distinguishable from "it said no";
 *   a false accusation here trains the user to ignore the line entirely, which
 *   costs us the case it exists for.
