// FILE: remoteHostsCopy.ts
// Purpose: The user-approved strings for the remote-hosts settings surface, in
//          one place so a component cannot quietly reword them.
// Layer: Web / settings
//
// Every string here was signed off verbatim. Two of them are CONDITIONAL on
// facts about what the code actually does, and are commented where they appear:
// approval does not make a claim true, so each is only used on the branch where
// it is true.
