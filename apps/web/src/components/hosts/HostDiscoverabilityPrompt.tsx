/**
 * Asks once, on first sign-in into a shared workspace, whether this machine
 * should be shared with it.
 *
 * The prompt exists because Desktop registers its bundled host automatically
 * (ADR 0015) and discoverability defaults on (ADR 0002) — frictionless for a
 * solo user, but in a team that default would silently hand every member the
 * ability to run code on someone's laptop. So: personal orgs never see this,
 * and a team sees it exactly once.
 *
 * Both buttons are answers. Declining is a real choice that writes
 * `discoverable: false`, not a dismissal — there is no "ask me later", because
 * a modal that returns every launch is one people learn to click through.
