// FILE: environmentAttachment.ts
// Purpose: The one correct way to hold per-environment state that must follow a
//          CLIENT, not just an environment id.
// Layer: Web transport aggregation
// Exports: createEnvironmentAttachmentRegistry
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AS SHARED CODE
//
// Four subscribers attach something per environment: shell aggregation, thread
// streams, descriptor sync, provider-status sync. Three of them independently
// got the same detail wrong, and the fourth only avoided it because the bug had
// already been paid for once.
//
// The detail: the registry REPLACES a disposed entry with a new client object
// under the SAME environment id. A logout disposes a transport without
// deregistering, so this is routine rather than exceptional. Code that keys
// attachment on the environment id alone then sees the replacement as
// "already attached" and skips it — leaving whatever it stored pointing at a
// dead client whose listener registries `dispose()` already cleared. Nothing
// throws. That environment simply stops updating, which reads as a hang rather
// than a failure.
//
// Keying on the CLIENT makes the replacement visible, because a new object is
// not the old one. That is the whole fix, and it belongs in one place so the
// fifth subscriber inherits it instead of rediscovering it.

/**
 * Tracks one attachment per environment, re-attaching when the client changes.
 *
 * `attach` runs for a new environment AND for a replacement client. `release`
 * is called for an environment that has gone away, after its detach — use it
 * for state that must not outlive the connection (cached descriptors, provider
 * statuses), since a re-registered id may be an entirely different machine.
