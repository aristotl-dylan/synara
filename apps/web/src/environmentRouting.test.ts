// FILE: environmentRouting.test.ts
// Purpose: Proves a remote thread's mutations and uploads reach the REMOTE host,
//          never the local server, and that an unreachable host refuses loudly.
// Layer: Web transport routing tests
//
// Ownership here is POSITIONAL, matching the store: a thread belongs to the
// environment whose record holds it. Fixtures therefore place a thread shell or
// a project INSIDE an environment record rather than setting a side table, so a
// test cannot assert an ownership arrangement the real store cannot represent.
