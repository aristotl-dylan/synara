// FILE: environmentRoutingCoverage.test-d.ts
// Purpose: Break the BUILD when a thread-scoped NativeApi method is added
//          without a routing decision.
// Layer: Web transport routing tests (type-level)
//
// WHY THIS IS A TYPE TEST AND NOT A RUNTIME ONE
//
// The previous runtime check filtered the contract through a hand-written list
// of the same seven method names the implementation used, so a method missing
// from BOTH lists agreed with itself and passed. Four holes in this epic have
// now shipped behind exactly that shape.
//
// Here the thread-scoped set is DERIVED BY THE COMPILER from the NativeApi
// contract — a method whose first argument structurally carries `threadId` is
// thread-scoped, whatever it is named and whoever adds it. Nothing in this file
// restates that set. The only hand-written input is the routing DECISION
// (route it, or excuse it as local-only), which is the thing a human must
// actually make. Leave a thread-scoped method out of both tables and
// `bun typecheck` fails; it cannot ship.

/**

 *
 * Same structural derivation as the thread-scoped set, and the reason it must
 * exist: a `cwd` carries no host identity, so one of these left unrouted does
 * not fail — it silently succeeds against the wrong machine's checkout.
 *
 * THIS CHECK HAS ALREADY HAD THAT BUG ITSELF. It first matched only a REQUIRED
 * `{ readonly cwd: string }`, which structurally cannot see `cwd?:`. Six
 * path-scoped methods — `filesystem.browse` and five provider discovery calls —
 * were therefore unrouted behind a check reporting full coverage, and nothing
 * errored, which is the only reason it survived review. The guard was asserting
 * a completeness it did not have.
 *
 * The lesson is about the SHAPE of the failure, not the fix: a structural match
 * is only as complete as the shapes it enumerates, and every shape it omits is
 * invisible BY CONSTRUCTION rather than merely untested. Narrowing the match
 * below — dropping the optional branch, requiring a more specific type —
 * reopens the hole silently. Widen it when in doubt; a false positive costs a
 * table entry, a false negative costs someone's working tree.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT OF THIS CHECK: it only sees a path carried as a FIELD of the
 * first argument. `shell.openInEditor(cwd, editor)` passes it POSITIONALLY and
 * is therefore invisible here, as would be any future method shaped that way.
 * All three `shell.*` methods are desktop surfaces on the user's own machine
 * (open an editor, open a browser, reveal in Finder) and are refused on a
 * remote host by `editor-launch` / `desktop-dialogs` in
 * environmentCapabilities.ts rather than routed — so the gap is covered today,
 * but it is covered by a refusal a human wrote, NOT by this check. A new
 * positional-path method would slip through silently. Prefer an input object
 * for anything new that names a path.
