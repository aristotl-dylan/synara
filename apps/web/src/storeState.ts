/**
 * Everything one server owns.
 *
 * This is the unit of ownership in the store, and ownership is POSITIONAL: a
 * thread belongs to the environment whose record holds it, so there is no
 * side table to keep in step and no site that can forget to filter. Every
 * collection here was previously a flat, globally-shared map paired with an
 * `environmentIdBy*Id` lookup, and seven separate call sites read one of them
 * without applying the filter its siblings applied — a stale shell fence, two
 * snapshot paths that deleted other servers' projects and spaces, two tombstone
 * maps compared against a foreign server's sequence, and a hydration flag any
 * server could set. Keying by environment makes each of those unrepresentable
 * rather than merely fixed.
 *
 * The corollary is the rule the aggregation layer enforces: sequences, cursors
 * and fences are only ever compared INSIDE one of these records. Cross-server
 * combination happens at the list level, over already-reduced values.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARANTEES, PRECISELY — the distinction matters when reading the
 * projection. TYPES enforce the inner layer: a helper that takes an
 * `EnvironmentState` cannot reach a second environment, so the four ownership
 * bugs this shape replaced are unwritable there, not merely fixed. TYPES DO NOT
 * enforce the ROUTING layer: `environmentIdForThread` /
 * `environmentIdForProject` and their call sites are ordinary runtime logic, and
 * a transition routed to the wrong environment is a plain bug caught only by a
 * test — which is exactly how a hardcoded local scope survived review here.
 * Treat any new routing decision as needing a test, and mutation-check the call
 * site as well as the lookup: they fail independently.
