/**
 * Retains a thread's detail speculatively — for scroll position or navigation
 * intent, not because anything is rendering it.
 *
 * A speculative retain is only cheap while the thread has a resume cursor: its
 * stream resumes from cached detail instead of opening a full-history snapshot.
 * When the cursors are reset (a server-generation change), that premise is gone,
 * so the retain releases itself immediately. Eligibility is therefore never
 * trusted from the render that admitted it: React does not re-run on the cursor
 * map, so a stale render would otherwise leave every prewarmed thread retained
 * and registered, and the reconnect would rebuild each one as a full-snapshot
 * stream — the burst this gate exists to prevent.
 *
 * Cursors and their reset notice are environment-scoped; this reads the local
 * environment because sidebar prewarm is not environment-aware yet. Injecting
 * both hooks keeps the seam explicit for when it becomes so. That seam must be
 * closed — the retain keyed by (EnvironmentId, ThreadId) — before any remote
 * environment can be registered; see the KNOWN GAP note at the top of
 * threadDetailSubscriptionRetention.ts.
 *
 * Returns null when the thread is not eligible, so callers cannot accidentally
 * hold a retain they never took.
