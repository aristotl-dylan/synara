// FILE: environmentRoutedApi.ts
// Purpose: One choke point that sends every THREAD- and PROJECT-scoped call to
//          the environment that owns it.
// Layer: Web transport routing
// Exports: createEnvironmentRoutedApi, ROUTED_METHODS, LOCAL_ONLY_THREAD_METHODS
//
// SCOPE: thread- and project-keyed calls only. Calls keyed by a bare `cwd`
// path are NOT routed and still run locally — see the KNOWN GAP note above
// `readStringField` before assuming any operation follows a thread to its host.

 * Groups of the NativeApi that carry thread-scoped methods, and the methods in
 * each that are routed to the thread's own server.
 *
 * This is a routing decision, not a wire change: `environmentId` never enters
 * any request schema. It only decides which per-environment NativeApi receives
 * the call.
 *
 * Membership here is not a matter of taste — `environmentRouting.test.ts`
 * derives the thread-scoped set from the NativeApi CONTRACT and fails at
 * TYPE-CHECK time if a method whose input names a thread is missing from this
 * table and is not explicitly excused in `LOCAL_ONLY_THREAD_METHODS`.

 * Thread-scoped methods that are deliberately NOT routed, and why.
 *
 * The embedded browser is a webview surface on the USER'S machine — a panel in
 * their own window — not a resource belonging to the thread's host. Routing
 * these would send webview control to a headless VPS that has no display.
 * `wsNativeApi.ts` implements them against `window.desktopBridge` or an
 * in-memory fallback workspace, never against the transport, so routing them
 * would also be a no-op at best.
 *
 * This list exists so that "not routed" is an explicit, reviewed decision
 * rather than an omission: the contract test requires every thread-scoped
 * method to appear in exactly one of these two tables.

/**
 * KNOWN GAP — `cwd`-keyed calls are NOT routed. Do not read this module as
 * covering them.
 *
 * Roughly 35 inputs identify their target by a bare filesystem path (`cwd`)
 * and carry no thread or project id: 22 `git.*` methods (checkout,
 * createBranch, createWorktree, stageFiles, pull, status, ...), 6 `project.*`
 * (readFile, writeFile, runDevServer, ...), `filesystem.browse`,
 * `shell.openInEditor`, `provider.listModels`/`listAgents`/`skillsCatalog`,
 * and two `server.generate*` methods. A path carries no host identity, so the
 * thread/project key this module routes on cannot answer for them, and they
 * all run on the LOCAL server.
 *
 * Why this is worse than a plain missing feature: `/Users/me/dev/foo`
 * plausibly exists on BOTH machines. The failure is therefore not an error but
 * a SILENT SUCCESS against the wrong checkout — `git.checkout` or
 * `project.writeFile` landing on the laptop while the UI says the thread runs
 * on a remote host. That is data loss, not a wrong result.
 *
 * `git.handoffThread` is the one member of that family fixable today, because
 * it happens to carry `threadId` alongside `cwd`; it is routed above.
 *
 * The agreed fix is a path-ownership index over project `workspaceRoot` and
 * thread `worktreePath` feeding a three-state resolver
 * (`local` | `remote` | `unknown`), where `unknown` resolves local while no
 * remote host is registered and refuses once one is. It is deliberately NOT in
 * this change: it is a larger, separately-reviewable piece of work. Until it
 * lands, any UI that lets a user create work on a remote host must not imply
 * that path-scoped operations follow it there.
