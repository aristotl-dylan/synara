// FILE: remoteBootstrap.ts
// Purpose: Drive an upload-first bootstrap of a Synara server onto a remote
//          host: stage the exact-version artifacts, verify their checksums on
//          the far side, activate by symlink swap, install the supervisor, and
//          verify the provisioning handshake before anyone is allowed to talk
//          to it. Interrupted runs resume; failed activations roll back.
// Layer: Server / remote broker
// Exports: bootstrapRemoteServer, uninstallRemoteServer, rollbackRemoteServer,
//          readRemoteReleaseId, BootstrapOutcome, BootstrapProgress,
//          UpgradeRefusedError
//
// Crash safety model
// ------------------
// The only mutation that changes what runs is the `current` symlink swap. It is
// done by creating a uniquely-named sibling link and `mv -T`-ing it over the
// destination, which is a single rename(2) — NOT `ln -sfn`, which unlinks and
// then re-creates, leaving a window where `current` resolves to nothing at all.
// Everything before the swap (upload, checksum, extract) happens in `staging/`
// and `releases/<id>/`, which are inert. So an interruption at any point leaves
// either the old release running or the new one, never a half-written tree
// behind `current`.
//
// The same rename discipline covers the credential: it is written to a temp
// file and renamed into place, and the outgoing credential is copied aside
// first so a rollback can restore the token the old release still expects.
//
// Resume is content-addressed rather than journalled: a re-run re-checksums the
// remote staged file and skips the upload only when it already matches. A
// truncated file from a killed upload fails that check and is re-uploaded, so a
// partial transfer can never be mistaken for a complete one.

 * Removing a host is client-side only: it drops cached rows, resume cursors and
 * the socket, and touches nothing on the remote. The remove confirmation
 * promises the user exactly that — "Threads that ran on this host stay on the
 * host itself — they'll come back if you add it again." This function ends in
 * `rm -rf -- <installRoot>`, so wiring it to Remove would delete the data that
 * sentence guarantees is safe: approved copy becomes a lie and the user loses
 * work they were told they could get back. "Remove" reading like "uninstall" is
 * the plausible mistake, which is why the hazard is recorded here and not just
 * the rule.
 *
 * There is deliberately no uninstall affordance in the UI at all — a user who
 * wants the files gone ssh's in themselves. If that ever changes it needs its
 * own action, its own confirmation, and its own copy stating what is deleted.
