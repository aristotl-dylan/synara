// FILE: remoteEnvironmentPipeline.test.ts
// Purpose: The pipeline's ORDERING and its refusals — that nothing is published
//          before the handshake, that a darwin host is refused before anything
//          is uploaded, and that a build with no artifacts reports rather than
//          crashes.
// Layer: Server / remote broker tests
