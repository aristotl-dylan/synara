// FILE: sshTunnel.ts
// Purpose: Hold an SSH local-forward open from a loopback port on this machine
//          to the remote server's own loopback port, and make its death
//          observable. This is the ONLY way bytes reach a remote Synara: the
//          browser talks to `/env/:envId/*` on the local origin, the proxy
//          connects to the near end of this forward, and nothing anywhere
//          addresses the remote host directly.
// Layer: Server / remote broker
// Exports: openSshTunnel, SshTunnel, SshTunnelError, reserveLoopbackPort,
//          releaseReservedPort
//
// Lifetime model
// --------------
// `-N` means the ssh child runs no remote command, so the child's lifetime IS
// the tunnel's lifetime. That is deliberate: it gives exactly one thing to
// watch. When the child exits for any reason — network death, the remote
// sshd restarting, someone killing it — `onClosed` fires once and the caller
// retracts the environment. There is no second, quieter failure mode where the
// process lives on with a forward that no longer forwards, because
// `ExitOnForwardFailure=yes` turns that state into an exit too.
//
// Teardown must be deterministic on BOTH paths — a failed open and an explicit
// close — because the thing being leaked is an OS process holding a network
// connection, and a leaked one is invisible until the machine runs out of
// something. `close()` is therefore idempotent, waits for the child to actually
// go away, and escalates to SIGKILL rather than trusting SIGTERM.

 * port number, not an inherited socket — so it is NARROWED (the probe socket is
 * closed as late as possible) and DETECTED (`ExitOnForwardFailure` makes a lost
 * race an immediate, reported exit rather than a silent half-tunnel).
