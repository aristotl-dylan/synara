// FILE: remoteEnvironmentPipeline.ts
// Purpose: THE COMPOSITION. Takes one saved RemoteHostConfig and drives it all
//          the way to a published environment the browser can reach: probe →
//          bootstrap → tunnel → handshake → publish.
// Layer: Server / remote broker
// Exports: bringUpRemoteEnvironment, RemoteEnvironmentBringUp,
//          RemoteEnvironmentUnsupportedError
//
// This file exists because every piece below it was built, tested, and had zero
// production callers. The modules were never the gap; the WIRE between them
// was. So the only thing here is ordering, and the invariants that ordering has
// to hold:
//
//  1. NOTHING is published to the proxy before the handshake has passed. That
//     order lives in `openRemoteEnvironmentSession` and is not re-implemented.
//  2. The environmentId is the one the BOOTSTRAP provisioned and the handshake
//     echoed back. It is never generated here, and never accepted from a
//     client.
//  3. A host we cannot supervise (darwin) fails as a STRUCTURED reason, before
//     anything is uploaded — not as an obscure systemd error halfway through.
//  4. Every failure unwinds what it got through. Partial state that outlives a
//     failed attempt is what makes the next attempt behave differently from the
//     first.
