// FILE: handshakeProbe.ts
// Purpose: The transport half of the provisioning handshake — ask the remote
//          server, through the tunnel, who it thinks it is. The DECISION about
//          whether that answer is acceptable stays in provisioningHandshake.ts;
//          this file only fetches a claim and refuses to invent one.
// Layer: Server / remote broker
// Exports: probeHandshakeOverTunnel, HandshakeProbeError
//
// What is NOT sent
// ----------------
// Only the credential this broker minted for THIS environment. No provider
// credential, no API key, no user token ever crosses this boundary — the remote
// authenticates its own providers, and readiness DETECTS what is signed in
// there rather than supplying it. If you find yourself adding a field to this
// request, that is the rule to check it against.
