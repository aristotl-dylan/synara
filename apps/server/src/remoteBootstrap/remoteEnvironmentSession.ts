// FILE: remoteEnvironmentSession.ts
// Purpose: Compose the pieces into one reversible operation — open the tunnel,
//          verify the handshake through it, publish the environment to the
//          proxy — such that a failure at ANY point leaves nothing behind.
// Layer: Server / remote broker
// Exports: openRemoteEnvironmentSession, RemoteEnvironmentSession
//
// The invariant this file exists to hold
// --------------------------------------
// An environment is registered with the proxy ONLY after the handshake passed.
// Publishing first and verifying after would open a window in which the browser
// can reach an unverified server, and there is no length of window that is
// acceptable for that. So the order is fixed: tunnel, verify, publish — and
// every early exit unwinds exactly what it got through.
//
// Teardown is the other half. `close()` retracts the environment BEFORE tearing
// down the tunnel, because the reverse order leaves the proxy briefly holding a
// registration whose upstream port is already dead — every request through it
// answering 502 instead of 404.
