// FILE: httpBuildSkewGuard.ts
// Purpose: Apply the build-skew read-only degradation to HTTP write routes, so
//          the policy is not enforced on the WebSocket transport alone.
// Layer: Server transport security

//          isHttpRequestBuildSkewed, buildSkewHttpRejection,

/**

 * The recovery routes, named individually.
 *
 * The intent above is right and unchanged; the PREFIX was the wrong mechanism
 * for it. Exempting everything under `/api/auth/` also exempted operations that
 * help nobody recover: revoking another client's session, revoking every other
 * device, revoking a pairing link. None is on the path from "my client is
 * skewed" to "my client is no longer skewed" — each destroys access for someone
 * else, irreversibly, issued from a client the server has ALREADY decided it
 * cannot trust to make changes. `revoke-others` is the sharpest: a user on a
 * stale build signs out every other device, unrecoverable without the host.
 *
 * `logout` is recovery, not destruction. It ends the CALLER'S OWN session, from
 * the caller's own authenticated identity, and cannot reach anyone else's; it
 * is also how a user reaches a clean re-pair.
 *
 * An allowlist also inverts the default in the safe direction: a NEW route
 * under `/api/auth/` is guarded unless someone explicitly exempts it, rather
 * than exempt by accident of where it was filed. A prefix grants by pattern —
 * which is the same shape as the routing-coverage holes on this branch, where
 * "matches the shape" silently stood in for a decision nobody made per case.

/**
 * Classifies an HTTP request's build identity, reusing the WebSocket rule for
 * the comparison itself. The identity travels in the query string under the
 * existing `WS_COMPATIBILITY_QUERY.clientBuild` key rather than a new HTTP-only
 * carrier.
 *
 * ONE DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE from the WebSocket path: a request that asserts no
 * build at all is NOT treated as skewed. The WS upgrade can fail those closed
 * because negotiation makes the build mandatory there — every client that
 * reaches the socket has stamped one. HTTP has no such negotiation, and these
 * routes accept explicit bearer auth from callers that are not the web client
 * and have no build to declare. Failing those closed would deny a class of
 * legitimate client outright, and would also mask the routes' own auth and
 * origin refusals behind a skew error.
 *
 * That is sound because skew is not an authorization boundary — auth and origin
 * checks are separate and unchanged. This guard exists to make the client's
 * read-only banner truthful, and a client that knows it is skewed is exactly
 * the one that stamps its build.
