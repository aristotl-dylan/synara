// personal one the first time they sign in. Organizations are the unit of host
// ownership, so every authorized request needs this answer and most requests
// need it more than once — hence the short-lived cache. Provider-neutral: the
// provider's calls arrive as injected functions speaking seam types.
// Layer: API identity (implementation support)
// Depends on: interfaces.ts (seam types).
