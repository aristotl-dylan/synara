// FILE: identity/interfaces.ts
// Purpose: The identity adapter seam. Synara's domain — the routes and

// SDK-isms, error spellings, and wire shapes stop at the sibling
// implementation modules; nothing provider-specific may appear here.
// Layer: API identity (contract)
// Depends on: @synara/contracts (shared wire types) only.
