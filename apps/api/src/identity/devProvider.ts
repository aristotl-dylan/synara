// FILE: identity/devProvider.ts
// Purpose: The "dev" identity provider — a second, offline implementation of
// the adapter seam so contributors can hack on Synara accounts with no hosted
// identity tenancy. It runs the same in-process identity double the test
// suite uses (testing/fakeWorkos.ts) on an ephemeral port and points the
// hosted-provider adapter at it, so there is exactly one implementation of
// the grant mechanics and the double stays the single source of fake
// behavior. One-time sign-in codes are printed to stdout instead of emailed;
// the SSO authorize page self-approves as the dev user.
// Layer: API identity (implementation, development only)
// Depends on: config (the safety gate), testing/fakeWorkos.ts, workos.ts.
