# @synara/api

The Synara account service: WorkOS AuthKit for identity, plus account/host
routes under `/api/v1`.

It is a **self-hosting-first, opt-in** component. Synara works fully without it;
nothing in this app runs unless you deploy an instance and point a server at it.

## Off by default, and no secrets in this repo

- **No instance runs unless you start one.** No telemetry endpoint is baked
  into the code, and nothing contacts an account service on its own.
- **With `IDENTITY_PROVIDER=workos` (the default), `WORKOS_API_KEY` and
  `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID` are required**; the dev provider needs neither and refuses
  to coexist with a real key.
- **The CLI is gated on `SYNARA_ACCOUNT_URL`.** `synara auth` (host linking)
  and `synara status` only talk to an account service when that variable (or
  `synara auth --account-url`) names one. Unset, `synara status` prints
  "account features are not configured" and the CLI never opens a socket to
  anything. Sign-in itself is app-only.
- **The in-app flow defaults to the hosted service.** Signing in from the app's
  UI is an explicit opt-in by the person clicking the button, so it falls back
  to `DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_URL` (`packages/shared/src/account.ts`) when the variable
  is unset. Nothing happens until that button is pressed. Point it elsewhere
  with the same `SYNARA_ACCOUNT_URL`.
- **No credentials are committed.** Every secret is read from the environment at
  boot (see `src/config.ts`). `apps/api/.env` is gitignored; `.env.example`
  carries names and comments only, never values. Host and device tokens live on
  the operator's machine under `<synara home>/account-credentials.json` at mode
  `0600`, never in the repository.

## Identity: WorkOS AuthKit behind an adapter seam

This service does not store users, passwords, or WorkOS sessions. WorkOS owns
those. Synara does own an Ed25519 API signing key supplied at boot for host
grants and relay tickets; only its public keys are served from
`GET /api/v1/keys/jwks`. The database holds the additive host/account registry
(`hosts`, legacy `host_tokens`, `devices`, link challenges and revocations)
plus Synara-owned profiles.

The domain never talks to WorkOS directly: routes depend on the identity and
registry interfaces in `src/identity/interfaces.ts`. WorkOS implements user
verification and membership grants; the database-backed host/device/key and
revocation modules are provider-independent and wired alongside the retained
legacy host-token adapters in `src/identity/index.ts`.

### Two ways in

The app offers email OTP in-app and SSO through the browser, and this service
backs both:

- **Email OTP** — `POST /api/v1/auth/otp/send` asks WorkOS to email a 6-digit
  Magic Auth code; `POST /api/v1/auth/otp/authenticate` redeems it, signing up
  the user on first redemption. The proxy exists because the Magic Auth grant
  is a confidential-client grant: it requires the client secret, so the app
  cannot make the call itself. The code is **pass-through** at every step —
  read off the request, handed to WorkOS, and never written to the database, a
  log line, or an error message. `src/identity/workos.ts` deliberately uses a
  separate request helper for these calls, because the general one puts the
  upstream response body into the thrown error and WorkOS echoes offending
  fields. Send is limited to 2/min per client, redemption to 5/min, each on
  its own budget below the authorize route's 10/min. There is **no password
  auth**.
- **SSO** — "Continue with Google/Apple/GitHub" takes the authorization-code
  grant with PKCE and a loopback redirect, finishing on the WorkOS hosted
  page in a real browser — the only auth step that leaves the app. Every leg
  is proxied here: the authorize URL (`POST /api/v1/auth/authorize`), the
  code exchange (`POST /api/v1/auth/authorize/token`), and refresh
  (`POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`) — the client never talks to WorkOS, so a
  different identity backend is a server-side swap.

Both converge on the same token pair, so everything downstream — workspace
scoping, credential storage, refresh — is one code path.

## Hosts are account entities shared through organizations

Ownership is keyed on **`hosts.owner_user_id`**. Every user
gets a personal organization the first time they use the service — provisioned
lazily, named `Personal — <email>` — so there is no "personal account" concept
separate from a workspace. Teams later are the same organization with more
members: an invite, not a migration.

- Owners can manage and reach their hosts across their active workspace
  context. A non-owner can see/use a host only when it is discoverable and
  both users are members of `hosts.owner_org_id`.
- `hosts.registered_by_user_id` records who ran the registration. It is an
  audit trail only and is never consulted for access — otherwise someone who
  left an organization would keep reaching the hosts they happened to register.
- The unique index remains `(owner_org_id, environment_id)` for additive
  compatibility, while keypair link completion unlinks every other row for
  the same environment id so one machine has only one live account link.

WorkOS mints sign-in tokens **without** an `org_id` claim, so the first call
after a sign-in is always refused with `403 organization_required`. That
response carries the caller's organizations, and the client refreshes with
`organization_id` to obtain a scoped token before retrying. The same 403
answers a token naming an organization the caller has since left, which is what
makes a revoked membership take effect without anything being purged.

Membership lists are cached per process for 60 seconds, so a burst of requests
costs one round trip while an added or removed member still takes effect on its
own.

## What WorkOS owning identity means in practice

- **Sign-in methods are dashboard toggles, not env vars.** Magic Auth (email
  OTP), Google, GitHub, Microsoft and the rest are enabled per-application in
  the WorkOS dashboard. There are no OAuth client ids or secrets to register
  here, and no provider pairs in the environment. The OTP routes above will
  fail against an application that has Magic Auth switched off, which is a
  dashboard change rather than a deploy.
- **Email verification is WorkOS's decision, not ours.** Redeeming an OTP
  implicitly verifies the address, so the challenge should not fire on the
  OTP path — if WorkOS answers `email_verification_required` anyway, the
  service classifies it into a terse 403 telling the user to sign in with an
  emailed code instead. There is no in-app challenge flow.
- **Email delivery is WorkOS's.** OTP mail is sent by WorkOS, so there is no
  SMTP or Resend configuration.
- **There are two JWKS roles.** WorkOS's JWKS verifies user access tokens. The
  service also derives a stable Ed25519 key from `API_SIGNING_KEY`, serves its
  public JWK (plus `API_SIGNING_KEY_PREVIOUS` during rotation), and signs host
  grants/relay tickets. WorkOS mode fails closed when this key is absent.
- **The issuer and JWKS URL are discovered, not guessed.** On its first token
  verification the service fetches WorkOS's OIDC metadata document at
  `{WORKOS_API_URL}/user_management/{WORKOS_CLIENT_ID}/.well-known/openid-configuration`
  and caches the `issuer` and `jwks_uri` it returns for the process lifetime.
  This matters: WorkOS scopes `iss` to the **environment's** client id
  (`https://api.workos.com/user_management/client_…`), which is _not_
  `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID` whenever your AuthKit application is not the environment
  default. Any locally derived issuer would reject every real token.
- **Discovery failure is fatal, by design.** Without a trusted issuer a token
  minted for some other tenancy could pass, so verification errors out naming
  the metadata URL rather than relaxing the check.
- **`WORKOS_ISSUER` / `WORKOS_JWKS_URL` are overrides.** Set them only for a
  custom auth domain or a stand-in that serves no metadata document; an
  explicit value always wins over discovery.

### Dashboard setup

1. Create an AuthKit application at <https://dashboard.workos.com>.
2. Under **Authentication**, enable the sign-in methods you want (Magic Auth
   for email codes; Google, Apple, and GitHub for SSO — Sign in with Apple
   additionally needs an Apple Developer Services ID and key configured on the
   WorkOS side).
3. Add `http://127.0.0.1:*/callback` to the allowed redirect URIs — the
   desktop PKCE flow redirects to a loopback listener on an ephemeral port
   (wildcard-port loopback redirects are allowed in all WorkOS environments).
4. Copy the API key and client id into `WORKOS_API_KEY` / `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`.

## Quick start (local)

```sh
docker compose -f apps/api/docker-compose.yml up -d          # Postgres 18 on :5432
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env                       # then fill in the WorkOS keys
bun install
bun run --cwd apps/api dev                                   # http://localhost:8788
```

Migrations run automatically at boot (`runMigrations` in `src/index.ts`), so an
empty database is fine. To generate new SQL after a schema change, use
`bun run --cwd apps/api db:generate`; to apply without booting the server, use
`db:migrate`.

Then sign in from the Synara app (account menu), and from a server checkout:

```sh
SYNARA_ACCOUNT_URL=http://localhost:8788 bun run --cwd apps/server src/index.ts auth    # link this host
SYNARA_ACCOUNT_URL=http://localhost:8788 bun run --cwd apps/server src/index.ts status
```

## Developing without a WorkOS account

### The dev identity provider (recommended)

Set `IDENTITY_PROVIDER=dev` and the service swaps the whole identity seam for
an offline implementation — no WorkOS tenancy, no network, no extra process:

```sh
IDENTITY_PROVIDER=dev DATABASE_URL=postgres://synara:synara@localhost:5432/synara_accounts \
  ACCOUNT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8788 API_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:8788/api/v1 \
  bun run --cwd apps/api dev
```

- Any email signs in. The 6-digit OTP code is **printed to the API's stdout**
  (`[dev-identity] OTP for you@example.com: 000001`) instead of emailed — type
  it into the app's sign-in dialog.
- SSO sign-ins self-approve as the dev user: the authorize page 302s straight
  back to the loopback listener, standing in for the browser hop.
- Users, organizations, and codes are in-memory and die with the process; the
  host registry and profiles still live in Postgres as usual.

It refuses to start — by design, with a process exit — when `NODE_ENV` is
`production` or when `WORKOS_API_KEY` is set: printing sign-in codes to stdout
is only acceptable on a machine where the operator at the terminal is the only
user, and a real WorkOS secret means the environment is meant to serve real
users. Internally it runs the same in-process double the test suite uses
behind the same WorkOS adapter that runs in production, so the code path you
exercise is the deployed one.

### The standalone stub (WorkOS env-wiring testing)

`scripts/fake-workos.ts` runs that same double as a standalone server, so the
full in-app sign-in flow works against a _normally configured_ API with no
WorkOS tenancy. SSO authorize requests self-approve as the dev user and OTP
codes print to the stub's stdout — which is what makes the flow headless.
Prefer this over `IDENTITY_PROVIDER=dev` when you specifically want to
exercise the env-var wiring of the WorkOS configuration itself.

```sh
bun run --cwd apps/api scripts/fake-workos.ts        # :8790
```

It prints the environment to point the API at:

```sh
export WORKOS_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8790
export WORKOS_API_KEY=fake
export WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_01FAKE
```

The stub serves the same OIDC metadata document real WorkOS does — including an
environment-scoped issuer that differs from the client id — so the discovery
path is exactly the one production takes, and neither `WORKOS_ISSUER` nor
`WORKOS_JWKS_URL` needs setting.

Start the API with those set, then sign in from the app as usual: SSO lands
straight back in the app, OTP codes print in the stub's terminal, and you end
up with a real credentials file (and, after `synara auth`, a registered host).

| Flag                 | Default         | Purpose                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--port`             | `8790`          | Listen port.                                                                                                |
| `--client-id`        | `client_01FAKE` | Client id to serve.                                                                                         |
| `--access-token-ttl` | `5m`            | Access-token lifetime. Set something like `30s` to exercise the refresh path.                               |
| `--organization`     | none            | Pre-create an organization the dev user joins. Repeatable — pass it twice to exercise the workspace picker. |

With no `--organization`, the dev user belongs to nothing and the API
provisions their personal organization lazily, which is the path a real
first-time sign-in takes. The stub mints sign-in tokens without an `org_id`
claim and honours `organization_id` on the refresh grant, exactly as WorkOS
does, so the 403-then-refresh dance is real here too.

The stub mints **single-use refresh tokens**, exactly as WorkOS does, so a
client that fails to persist a rotation is locked out here the same way it would
be in production. It is dev tooling only — nothing in `src/` imports it, and it
is never reachable from a deployed instance.

### Manual checklist against a real WorkOS tenancy

The stub verifies the shape of the flow, not WorkOS's behaviour. Before
trusting an instance against real WorkOS, confirm by hand:

1. **The loopback redirect URI is registered** in the dashboard
   (`http://127.0.0.1:*/callback`) — the SSO buttons error until it is.
2. "Continue with Google/Apple/GitHub" opens the provider page in the system
   browser and lands back in the app signed in; the email OTP dialog signs in
   with the code WorkOS mails.
3. `synara status` resolves your real name and email through `GET /me`.
4. A command run more than ~5 minutes after signing in still works — that is the
   refresh path, and the credentials file should hold a changed token pair
   afterwards.
5. Signing out of all sessions in the WorkOS dashboard makes the next refresh
   fail with a 4xx, and the CLI reports the session as expired rather than
   hanging or looping.
6. If you configured a custom auth domain, `WORKOS_ISSUER` matches it —
   otherwise every token is rejected. With no custom domain, leave it unset:
   discovery resolves the environment-scoped issuer, and a hand-written guess
   is the one thing that reliably breaks this.
7. **A refresh carrying `organization_id` yields a token with an `org_id`
   claim.** Everything about host access depends on it. Decode the stored
   access token after signing in and confirm the claim is there and matches
   the workspace you chose; without it every host route answers
   `organization_required` forever.
8. **The membership listing has the shape this service reads.**
   `GET /user_management/organization_memberships?user_id=…` must return
   `data[].organization_id` **and** `data[].organization_name`. The name is
   read inline rather than fetched per organization, so if a real tenancy omits
   it the workspace picker falls back to showing raw `org_…` ids.
9. Signing in as a brand-new user with no organizations provisions one, and the
   WorkOS dashboard shows both the organization and the membership afterwards.
   Two users must not end up sharing a personal organization.
10. **Real access tokens carry a `client_id` claim equal to `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`.**
    Verification refuses any token whose `client_id` does not match, and refuses
    one that omits the claim — that check is what stops a token minted for a
    sibling AuthKit application in the same environment from being accepted, as
    one issuer and one JWKS are shared across all of them. Decode a real access
    token (jwt.io, or `synara status` plus the credentials file) and confirm the
    claim is present with the expected value. If a tenancy is configured with
    Resource Indicators the audience may arrive as `aud` instead, in which case
    this check needs widening before that tenancy can sign in at all.

A missing required variable fails the boot with an explicit
`Missing required environment variables: …` rather than starting half-configured.

## Deploying to Railway

The service runs TypeScript directly under Bun, with no build step at all.

- **Build command:** `bun install`
- **Start command:** `bun run start`
- **Root directory:** `apps/api` (or run the commands with `--cwd apps/api` from
  the monorepo root, since this is a workspace package).
- **Variables:** set `DATABASE_URL`, `WORKOS_API_KEY`, `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`,
  `ACCOUNT_BASE_URL`, `API_PUBLIC_URL`, `API_SIGNING_KEY`, and
  `RELAY_SERVICE_TOKEN` at minimum. Leave `PORT` to
  Railway — it injects one, and `loadApiConfig` honours it. Set
  `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=1`: Railway terminates TLS in front of the service and
  appends exactly one `x-forwarded-for` hop; without it every caller shares the
  proxy's rate-limit bucket. Set `PROFILE_PROXY_SECRET` to the same value as
  the profiles deployment's, so public-profile rate limits key per visitor.

For Postgres, either add Railway's own Postgres plugin or point at
**PlanetScale**. A PlanetScale Postgres `DATABASE_URL` must include TLS:

```
postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?sslmode=verify-full
```

`sslmode=require` also connects but skips certificate verification; prefer
`verify-full`. Migrations run on boot, so the first deploy provisions the schema
with no extra release step.

Other platforms work the same way: any host that can run `bun run start` with a
Postgres URL and a persistent public origin is enough. There is no filesystem
state — everything lives in Postgres.

## Build and run

The server has **no bundle step**. It runs TypeScript directly under Bun, in
both development and production.

| Script  | What it does                                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `build` | Prints `no build step`. Kept so generic `bun run build` CI passes. |
| `start` | Runs the server from `src/index.ts`. There is no `dist/index.mjs`. |
| `dev`   | Same, with `--hot`.                                                |

**For packaging:** ship `src/`, `drizzle/`, and `node_modules`, then run
`start`. Do not look for a compiled server entrypoint — unlike `@synara/server`,
which builds to `dist/index.mjs`, this app deliberately has none.

## Tests

`bun run test` requires Postgres and a `TEST_DATABASE_URL`; without it the
database-backed suites skip. WorkOS is never called: `src/testing/fakeWorkos.ts`
serves a JWKS from a freshly generated key pair, mints access tokens signed by
it, and answers the OTP, PKCE, and refresh grants, so the auth path is
exercised end to end with no network. The same module backs the dev stub above.

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://synara:synara@localhost:5432/synara_accounts bun run test
```

Pointing the tests at the same database as dev is safe — there is no shared key
material for the two to fight over.
